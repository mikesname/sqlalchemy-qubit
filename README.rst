SQLAlchemy-Qubit is an attempt to create an SQLAlchemy ORM mapping for the Qubit Toolkit's data model.  The Qubit Toolkit is an
information management system developed by Artefactual Systems, built on PHP5 and the Symfony framework.  It is used as
the basis of ICA-Atom, and other library management tools.

The intended purpose of the SQLAlchemy ORM mapping is to facilitate data import and export from Python-based tools.  It is not
affiliated with the creators of the Qubit Toolkit.
